## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Efficient management of emergency rooms is essential for delivering quality patient care and optimizing hospital resources. This project focuses on analyzing key performance metrics such as patient wait times, satisfaction scores, admission trends, and referral sources to help hospital administrators make informed decisions.

## âœ… Key Features

- *Patient Wait Times Analysis*  
  Identify bottlenecks and delays to improve emergency room responsiveness.

- *Patient Satisfaction Scores*  
  Monitor and enhance patient experience through data-driven insights.

- *Admission Trends*  
  Track patterns in patient admissions for better resource allocation and planning.

- *Referral Sources*  
  Understand patient inflow from different sources and optimize referral pathways.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset includes anonymized hospital records covering patient flow, admission data, satisfaction surveys, and referral sources. The data has been cleaned and structured for effective visualization in Power BI.

(Optional: Add a link to your dataset if available or mention that sample/mock data is used.)

## ðŸ“Š Tools Used

- *Power BI* â€“ For interactive dashboards, reporting, and data visualization  
- *Data Modeling* â€“ Structuring data relationships for insightful analytics  
- *DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)* â€“ Custom calculations and metrics
